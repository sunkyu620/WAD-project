----Features-----
Our website consists of the 4 main features as described below:

1)	Module Planning
Planning for the next 4 whole years laid out in front of you is intimidating as it is frustrating. But fret not as ModPlanner is here to save the day! Conveniently add new modules to each respective term on your academic journey, and feel free to delete them if you change your mind. Module planning has never been easier!

2)	Job Portal
What are SMU students known for? Their awesome careers and internships! But job search can be a pain in the a** when the ocean of information in the vast World Wide Web makes you look for needles in a haystack. Our Job Portal is here to save the day with role-specific search that only gives you the most relevant results. Easily apply by clicking on "Apply here" to visit the actual job listing pages.

3)	Interactive To-Do List
As SMU students, we all have millions of tasks scribbled across a mental to-do list and...OOPS! What was the assignment I was supposed to submit today again? I forgot...again! *rolls eyes* Our to-do list lets you consolidate all tasks and keeps track of your progress using a fun-loving progress tracker that counts all your done and undone tasks, motivating you along the way. This encourages you to stay on top of your tasks and manage your time better. Don't say bojio!

4)	Daily Quote of the Day
As busy and sleep-deprived students, we sometimes run dry on inspirations and lose the motivation to keep moving forward. Our daily quotes serve to remind you of the things in life worth living for and striving towards. Quotes are dynamically retrieved and refreshes daily, making sure you are well-prepared to take on every day as a brand new challenge. After all, a quote a day keeps the sluggishness away!

5)	Module information at your fingertips
Keeping track of your modules is a breeze when you simply have to look on the right to view all modules you are taking in the current semester. In case you wish to read up on module information (yes, students sometimes forget what is expected of them in a course!), browse textbooks for sale (for THAT module) and read up on course or professor reviews, all your heart's desires will be in front of you with the click of a button that leads you to the SMUMods page for that module!
